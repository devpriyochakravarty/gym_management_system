 7. Database Schema

The project uses IndexedDB with the following object stores:

• users
• members
• bills
• feePackages
• notifications
• supplements
• dietPlans
• logs

Each store has a unique identifier and relevant fields for storing data.

 8. Security

• Passwords are stored in plain text in this demo version. In a production environment, implement proper password hashing.
• The application uses client-side storage, which has inherent security limitations. For a production system, consider implementing server-side authentication and data storage.

 9. Performance Optimization

• CSS animations are used judiciously to enhance user experience without impacting performance.
• IndexedDB is used for efficient client-side data storage and retrieval.
